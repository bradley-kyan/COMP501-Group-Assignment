	<h2>COIVD and Online Dating</h2>
	<p>In today's age, online dating presents an opportunity to the members of society to make meaningful relationships even while being isolated from one another due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Online dating allows people who wish to start a relationship to do so instantly, and without having to put themselves or the other person at risk during the pandemic.</p>
	
	<h2>Introverts and Online Dating</h2>
	<p>Introverts are natrually quiet people who prefer the comfort of silence to the comfort of people, meaning that most introverts would feel more comfortable talking to other people behind a screen, as there is less pressure without another person being present. With the introduction of online dating, introverts can talk and start relationships with other people in a more comfortable mannner for them, as the talking is done through a screen. This also means that as soon as the introvert feels comfortable with the other person, they can organise to meet in real life, and carry out a conversation comfortably in person (hopefully).</p>
