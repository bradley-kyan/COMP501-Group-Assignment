	<h2>Why online dating has grown to the point that it has today</h2>
	<h4>The popularity of online dating services</h4>
	<p> People today, find much difficulty when it comes to the scene of dating. Ones find it harder to find people that they would want to date, along with other obstacles including finding it hard to approach others, simply being too busy, and feeling that there are not enough people in their area to date (Barroso, 2020). </p>
	<p> Since its conception, dating services in all the forms it has taken throughout history, has set out to solve all these problems and make it easier and faster to find a suitable partner. Since the introduction of the first modern online dating services of kiss.com in 1994 and match.com in 1995 (POV, 2013), online dating services have since increased in popularity. </p>
	<p> This growth is notable from 11% of all American partnered adults using online dating services in 2013 (Smith & Duggan, 2013) to 12% of in 2020 (Barroso, 2020). This notable increase is also shown with how approximately one-in-five partnered adults ages 18 to 29 (21%) have meet their partner online which shows the popularity of online dating with young adults. </p>
	<p> This growth in popularity could be attributed to the ease that such services give to their users to find a partner. All a user has to do is either swipe left or right depending on if the like what they see, which is the case with the widely popular mobile application Tinder. Too, this growth could be from what we know about the positives aspects of such services, including, “more opportunities to meet potential partners, a relatively nonthreatening way to initiate contact, and the possibility that some sites’ questions may screen out people who would not be a good match in general.” (Wiederhold, 2015, p. 695–696) </p>
	<p> Despite the misconception that online dating leads to unfulfilling relationships, relationships which stemmed from online dating has proven to created more long-lasting relationships in comparison to their offline counterparts. This further adds to the appeal factor to online dating services and applications. A study conducted by Cacioppo et al., (2013) shows that one third of marriages between 2005 and 2012 were from spouses who met each other online, and these marriages had a slightly lower marital breakup percentage of 5.96% in comparison to 7.67%. </p>
	<h4>The effects of COVID-19 on the popularity of online dating</h4>
	<p> COVID-19 has changed the way people interact with one another which in effect has changed the dating scene. The COVID-19 pandemic forced a large portion of the world’s population to stay at home and not leave their house. This led many to experience “social disconnection, isolation and loneliness” (Ministry of Social Development, 2020, p. 15). To combat these feelings, along with the sudden spare time many found themselves to have, many yearned for romance. As people could not leave their homes, they turned to online services such as Tinder, Bumble, Grinder, OkCupid and Hinge. </p>
	<p> Since the beginning of COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 the use of online dating services has skyrocketed even further in popularity than previously seen. During the height of the COVID-19 pandemic Tinder recorded its highest ever swipe count on a single day in March 2020 of 3 billion, while OkCupid saw a 700% increase in dates from March to May 2020. (Fortune, 2021) </p>
	<!--Why online dating services have become prime targets for hackers-->
	<h2>Why online dating services have become prime targets for hackers</h2>
	<p> Online dating services normally require a lot of personal information to be disclosed by the user in order to set up an account. In the realm of cybersecurity, online dating services become prime targets for bad actors. This is because of the sheer amount of confidential data could be accessed if a bad actor could infiltrate such a services security. </p>
	<p> This private information could range from anything from emails, passwords, credit card information, full names, DOB, and home addresses. This information in the wrong hands could be catastrophic. There have been many examples of online dating services experiencing data breaches. One which was popular in the news at its time was the Ashley Maddison data breach in which real names, address, and credit card details were leaked. (Krebs on Security, 2015)
		This made headlines because the data included in the leak was data which the company said was to be deleted upon request. </p>
	<p> Other examples include the 2021 MeetMindful data breach, where 2.28 million users personal data was leaked including real names, geo-location data, DOB, email addresses, marital status etc. (Cimpanu, 2021). The Bumble data “breach in March 2020, when an unauthorized party accessed the company’s entire account database and exposed the profiles of Bumble’s roughly 100 million users.” (Rizzi, 2022). Or the 2018 Tinder data breach, where Tinder’s API was backwards engineered and data was collected on mass.</p>
	<!--The effects of COVID-19 on the popularity of online dating-->
	<h2>How online dating services handle and store user data.</h2>
	<p>Firstly, how is data handled and stored. There are two types of digital information: input and output data. Users provide the input data. Computers provide the output data. But a computer’s CPU can’t 
		compute anything or produce output without the user’s input. So that we can already see the co-dependency that user input and computer output has. Modern computers, or terminals, connect to storage devices 
		either directly or through a network. Users instruct computers to access data from and store data to these storage devices. However, at a fundamental level, there are two foundations to data storage: the form in which data 
		takes and the devices data is recorded and stored on. </p>
	<h4>Types of storage devices that are relevant</h4>
	<b>SSD and Flash Storage</b>
	<p>Flash storage is a solid-state technology that uses flash memory chips for writing and storing data. A solid-state disk (SSD) flash drive stores data using flash memory. Compared to HDDs, a solid-state system has no moving parts and, 
		therefore, less latency, so fewer SSDs are needed. Since most modern SSDs are flash-based, flash storage is synonymous with a solid-state system</p>
	<b>Cloud Storage (Private Cloud Storage)</b>
	<p>Cloud storage delivers a cost-effective, scalable alternative to storing files to on-premise hard drives or storage networks. Cloud service providers allow you to save data and files in an 
		off-site location that you access through the public internet or a dedicated 
		private network connection. The provider hosts, secures, manages, and maintains the servers and associated infrastructure and ensures you have access to the data whenever you need it.</p>
	<h4>Forms of Data Storage that are relevant</h4>
	<b>File Storage</b>
	<p>File storage, also called file-level or file-based storage, is a hierarchical storage methodology used to organize and store data. In other words, data is stored in files, the files are organized in folders and the folders are 
		organized under a hierarchy of directories and subdirectories.</p>
	<b>Block Storage</b>
	<p>Block storage, sometimes referred to as block-level storage, is a technology used to store data into blocks. The blocks are then stored as separate pieces, each with a unique identifier. Developers favor block storage for computing 
		situations that require fast, efficient and reliable data transfer.</p>
	<h3>To take home: </h3>
	<p>Observe to see if the website deletes the data you input after you close your account. Various services will allow you to delete or disable your account under settings tab. Occasionally users return to the platform, the site may 
		retain your information, such as Tinder, Bumble and Hinge, if not deactivated or deleted</p>
	<br>
	<h2>How do online dating services profile(categorize) their users, and what data is used to create this digital profile. </h2>
	<b>Swipe Algorithm</b>
	<p>Dating apps such as Tinder and Bumble have “secret internal ratings,” and “vaguely” how the system works. Essentially, the app used an Elo rating system, which is the same method used to calculate the skill levels of chess 
		players: You rose in the ranks based on how many people swiped right on (“liked”) you, but that was weighted based on who the swiper was. The more right swipes that person had, the more their right swipe on you meant for your score.</p>
	<b>Machine learning</b>
	<p>Machine learning is a method of data analysis that automates analytical model building. It is a branch of artificial intelligence based on the idea that systems can learn from data, identify patterns and make decisions with minimal human intervention.
		Resurging interest in machine learning is due to the same factors that have made data mining and Bayesian analysis more popular than ever. Things like growing volumes and varieties of available data, computational processing that is cheaper and more 
		powerful, and affordable data storage.
		All of these things mean it's possible to quickly and automatically produce models that can analyze bigger, more complex data and deliver faster, more accurate results – even on a very large scale. And by building precise models, an organization has 
		a better chance of identifying profitable opportunities – or avoiding unknown risks. Tinder obviously cares about making matches, but it cares more about the app feeling useful and the matches feeling real — as in, resulting in conversation and, 
		eventually, dates. It tracks when users exchange phone numbers and can pretty much tell which accounts are being used to make real-life connections and which are used to boost the ego of an over-swiper. If you get too swipe-happy, you may notice your 
		number of matches goes down, as Tinder serves your profile to fewer other users. </p>
	<b>High Traffic Profiles</b>
	<p>Tinder “crippling” the standard, free version of the app and making it basically unusable unless you pay for a premium account or add-ons, like extra Super Likes and Boosts (the option to serve your profile to an increased number of people in your 
		area for a limited amount of time). Profiling “free” and “premium” users.</p>
	<br>
	<h2>The potential effects a data breach can have on a service’s users.</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>
			<p>Because dating services collect large amounts of personal information, if data was leaked in a data breach, identity theft could occur to any user that has created an account with the service.</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p>If a user has subscribed to a paid service, their payment details are collected by the company, and a data breach could result in money being stolen from these users.</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p>Data such as information seen by the user, chat logs and ads interacted with is collected and when a user is looking for a partner, chats between two users could get incredibly personal. If this data is leaked, the user could end up feeling insecure, and their mental health might take a toll depending on how far the data has been spread.</p>
		</li>
	</ul>
	<br>
	<h2>How do dating services try to stop bad actors, whether being hackers, or ones who use their services for malicious purposes, i.e., mitigation for the safety of the end-user.</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>
			<p>Encryption would be a large part of the security of data transmitted across the web and the server. Most dating services use SSL to encrypt data that is being transmitted, however this does not stop the messages from being stored anywhere and hacked from the stored location.</p>
		</li>
		<ul>
			<li>
				<p>SSL provides a high level of privacy, as if a message is intercepted, the message will be unreadable and almost impossible to decrypt. </p>
			</li>
		</ul>
		<li>
			<p>A common practice which should be shared by all services that store data on a server would be the security of the physical servers themselves. This would include:</p>
		</li>
		<ul>
			<li>
				<p>Locking server rooms</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>Constant monitoring of physical servers</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>Monitoring of server reports</p>
			</li>
		</ul>
		<li>
			<p>As well as physically, the servers would:</p>
		</li>
		<ul>
			<li>
				<p>Be secured by a firewall (both a hardware and software firewall for maximum protection)</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>Be regularly backed up and updated</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>Have reliable maintenance services</p>
			</li>
		</ul>
		<li>
			<p>A large part of security would be the server workers themselves, and the dating service provider must train their employees to be aware of cybersecurity risks such as social engineering, secure passwords, and data confidentiality.</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p>To be aware of vulnerabilities in the app, many dating services run bug bounties that are open to the public so that bugs/vulnerabilities can be found quickly and reported frequently.</p>
		</li>
		<ul>
			<li>
				<p>A bug bounty is a challenge put out by the company for people to find vulnerabilities and bugs in the service. Any bugs/vulnerabilities found are rewarded</p>
			</li>
		</ul>
	</ul>

	<br>
	
	<h2>What sorts of personal information should a service gather, and how much personal data is too much.</h2>
	<p>According to the Tinder website, (Match Group, LLC. (n.d.)), Tinder collects this data that is “necessary for the service to work” when the app is in use:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Phone number</li>
			<li>Email address</li>
			<li>Gender</li>
			<li>Date of birth</li>
			<li>Information shown to the user</li>
			<li>Ads interacted with </li>
			<li>Members interacted with</li>
			<li>IP address</li>
			<li>Advertising ID</li>
			<li>Sexual preference</li>
		</ul>
	<p>Additional data that will be collected should the user participate in certain actions:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Optional profile data:</li>
				<ul>
					<li>A bio </li>
					<li>Interests</li>
					<li>Photos and videos</li>
				</ul>
			<li>Payment information (if the user subscribes to a paid service through Tinder and not an external platform such as IOS or Android)</li>
			<li>Responses to questions in any Tinder surveys that the user participates in</li>
			<li>Information used to enter any promotions, events or contests</li>
			<li>Information given when a user contacts the customer care team</li>
			<li>Published content in the app</li>
			<li>Precise geolocation data (even when the app is not in use should the user permit)</li>
		</ul>
	<p>Considering the fact Tinder is part of the Match Group family of businesses, data is also shared across the rest of the companies that fall into this group (Tinder, Match, Meetic, OkCupid, Hinge, Pairs, PlentyOfFish, and OurTime). </p>
	<p>The amount of data that is collected can be used to impersonate any user that has provided truthful information to the service, and used in scams to coerce more sensitive information out of a person/business. A leak in data could result in identity theft, and that’s where the security of the data collected would come in.</p>
	
	<br>

	<h2>And the rise of alternative services which don’t collect user data and the pros/cons/dangers of such services.</h2>
	<p>Technically speaking there is not a dating specific service in which do not collect some sort of data. Dating apps use their collected data to profile their users. This has led people to use other means in order to hookup/foster relationships.
		<br><br>
		One of the most popular alternative online dating methods is through the use of the Discord social media platform. What makes Discord an appealing method for people to date is because of the freedom it gives its users to manage their own chat room, aka “Server”, as well as the ease to set up a server. It is as simple as entering “in the server name,” and clicking “Create” (Discord, Inc. (2020)). Users can create traditional chat rooms where they can message one another, as well as video call and voice call other users, liken to other services such as Skype and Zoom.
		<br><br>
		Unlike dating services, individual Discord servers offer no concrete moderation, unless implemented by the server administrator. Despite Discord having its own community guidelines in regards to the content that can be available on their platform, this is not actively enforced. Discord’s community guidelines state that its users are encouraged when they “come across a user, message, or server that appears to break these guidelines, please report” the offense. (Discord, Inc. (2022))
		<br><br>
		This lack of enforcement has allowed for underground dating services to prosper which means that these types of services pose a threat to the end user. This is due to the types of individuals these services attract, as they cannot be sure if the person who they are talking to is a savory type of person.
