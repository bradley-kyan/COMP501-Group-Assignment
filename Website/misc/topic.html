<h1>Online Dating</h1>


</ul><h5><p>The page or area describing your chosen technology/topic and why it is significant and/or has important implications for society.<p></h5>

<p><em>When deciding on your chosen technology/topic, it is best not to choose something too broad, but limit the focus e.g. consider the level of social analysis from the figure below.</p></em>
<p><em>E.g. What is the level of analysis - culture or organization; Responsibility - individual or pro fessional; Ethical issue - power or equity; Technology - medical, nuclear, mobile?</p></em>

  <h2>How online dating services handle and store user data.</h2>
  <p>Firstly, how is data handled and stored. There are two types of digital information: input and output data. Users provide the input data. Computers provide the output data. But a computer’s CPU can’t 
    compute anything or produce output without the user’s input. So that we can already see the co-dependency that user input and computer output has. Modern computers, or terminals, connect to storage devices 
    either directly or through a network. Users instruct computers to access data from and store data to these storage devices. However, at a fundamental level, there are two foundations to data storage: the form in which data 
    takes and the devices data is recorded and stored on. 
  </p>
  <h4>Types of storage devices that are relevant</h4>
  <b>SSD and Flash Storage</b>
  <p>Flash storage is a solid-state technology that uses flash memory chips for writing and storing data. A solid-state disk (SSD) flash drive stores data using flash memory. Compared to HDDs, a solid-state system has no moving parts and, 
    therefore, less latency, so fewer 
    SSDs are needed. Since most modern SSDs are flash-based, flash storage is synonymous with a solid-state system</p>
    <b>Cloud Storage (Private Cloud Storage)</b>
    <p>Cloud storage delivers a cost-effective, scalable alternative to storing files to on-premise hard drives or storage networks. Cloud service providers allow you to save data and files in an 
      off-site location that you access through the public internet or a dedicated 
      private network connection. The provider hosts, secures, manages, and maintains the servers and associated infrastructure and ensures you have access to the data whenever you need it.</p>
      <h4>Forms of Data Storage that are relevant</h4>
      <b>File Storage</b>
      <p>File storage, also called file-level or file-based storage, is a hierarchical storage methodology used to organize and store data. In other words, data is stored in files, the files are organized in folders and the folders are 
        organized under a hierarchy of directories and subdirectories.</p>
      <b>Block Storage</b>
      <p>Block storage, sometimes referred to as block-level storage, is a technology used to store data into blocks. The blocks are then stored as separate pieces, each with a unique identifier. Developers favor block storage for computing 
        situations that require fast, efficient and reliable data transfer.</p>
        <h3>To take home: </h3>
        <p>Observe to see if the website deletes the data you input after you close your account. Various services will allow you to delete or disable your account under settings tab. Occasionally users return to the platform, the site may 
          retain your information, such as Tinder, Bumble and Hinge, if not deactivated or deleted</p>
          <br>
          </br>
          <h2>How do online dating services profile(categorize) their users, and what data is used to create this digital profile. </h2>
          <b>Swipe Algorithm</b>
          <p>Dating apps such as Tinder and Bumble have “secret internal ratings,” and “vaguely” how the system works. Essentially, the app used an Elo rating system, which is the same method used to calculate the skill levels of chess 
            players: You rose in the ranks based on how many people swiped right on (“liked”) you, but that was weighted based on who the swiper was. The more right swipes that person had, the more their right swipe on you meant for your score.</p>
            <b>Machine learning</b>
            <p>Machine learning is a method of data analysis that automates analytical model building. It is a branch of artificial intelligence based on the idea that systems can learn from data, identify patterns and make decisions with minimal human intervention.
              Resurging interest in machine learning is due to the same factors that have made data mining and Bayesian analysis more popular than ever. Things like growing volumes and varieties of available data, computational processing that is cheaper and more 
              powerful, and affordable data storage.
              All of these things mean it's possible to quickly and automatically produce models that can analyze bigger, more complex data and deliver faster, more accurate results – even on a very large scale. And by building precise models, an organization has 
              a better chance of identifying profitable opportunities – or avoiding unknown risks. Tinder obviously cares about making matches, but it cares more about the app feeling useful and the matches feeling real — as in, resulting in conversation and, 
              eventually, dates. It tracks when users exchange phone numbers and can pretty much tell which accounts are being used to make real-life connections and which are used to boost the ego of an over-swiper. If you get too swipe-happy, you may notice your 
              number of matches goes down, as Tinder serves your profile to fewer other users.
              </p>
              <b>High Traffic Profiles</b>
              <p>Tinder “crippling” the standard, free version of the app and making it basically unusable unless you pay for a premium account or add-ons, like extra Super Likes and Boosts (the option to serve your profile to an increased number of people in your 
                area for a limited amount of time). Profiling “free” and “premium” users.</p>
