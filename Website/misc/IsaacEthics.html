<h2>Isaacs's Ethical Issues and Response</h2>
<p>Data is collected everywhere nowadays, the searches we carry out on the internet, the things we post, and much more are collected as we use the internet everyday, yet online dating services go
	a step further, as conversations between two lovers (or people building up to that stage) who trust each other deeply are stored. This means that private information that is meaningful to a
	user could be stored as well, as they have shared that information with someone else that they trust deeply. This extra information that is stored with the use of online dating services
	gives all services a great power over informaton. Yes, privacy policies exist and they provide a legal fallback for most complications that occur, <b>but</b> something that must be noted is that 
	all the personal information could easily noted down by an individual with malicious intent who works for the online dating service, and used anonmymously. It isn't just the service with the power
	of information, but the individuals who work for the service too. 
	<br><br>
	My repsonse to this problem presented by all the data collected by these services would be to give the services as little information as possible, and to be aware of what data is collected by each service so that a user
	can ask themselves how that data could be used against them. Users of online dating services should move deeply personal conversations to other mediums of communication like SMS messages (which can 
	be configured to be stored in the device only) or in person (the most secure, but also the most risky if users aren't verified to be authentic).
