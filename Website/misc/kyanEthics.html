	<h2>Kyan's Ethical Issues and Response</h2>
	<p> My stand regarding the technological implications of online dating services has been moulded by my research into the technology that supports such platforms. I was not surprised at the amount of data online dating services collect on their users, including everything from geolocational data to credit card details. The biggest concern I find with using online dating services is not the issues that surround the collected data itself, but rather the risks that are imposed by third parties having access to that information. This includes the selling of user information, or worse, nefarious groups stealing said data.</p>
	<p> When people use such services, they put their trust in the service to keep their information confidential and safe. In the past, there have been many examples of services misusing user information and failing to keep it safe and confidential. We, the end-user have no idea if a company is implementing the correct steps to make sure data is secure until it is too late. The same applies to the selling of user data, as the end-user, we have no idea whether our information is being sold or not despite what might be said in the service’s terms of use. Why so? This is because history shows that there have been examples of companies selling data despite explicitly saying otherwise – deceiving their users.</p>
	<p> Regarding the security risks that are imposed by threat actors gaining user information, even if a company has implemented all the correct steps to secure user information, there is no way of knowing if there are any unknown exploits that could jeopardize the security of their data system. This further leads to the concerns that surround what sorts of data an online dating service should be collecting from its users. This is because the more data and wider the range of data collected, the greater the implications of a data breach. </p>
	<p>In response to the risks that are posed by using dating services that I just mentioned, I believe that everyone needs to make an informed decision before using a service. This could mean doing research into the track records of how the dating service has handled data, whether the service implements proper security measures to protect user data (SSL encryption etc.), or if the service is actively open with how end-user data is used. I feel that people have become much more reliant on online dating services to find a partner. Ones have strayed away from the more traditional avenues to find love. In my opinion, the sure-fire way to have complete control of your confidential information and to make sure it doesn’t end up spreading across the internet would be to break away, or outright not use online dating services, period. Use the traditional avenues at your disposal, talk to people, and get to know them in real life, face to face.</p>
