        <td> <em>While we were looking around at different sources of information talking about the effect on technology on society (Baecker, 2019), we thought up the idea of covering a topic which has impacted modern society in a more discreet way than something like COVID-19 or the Russian invasion of Ukraine. This is where the idea of online dating popped up, a relatively new concept that is changing societal norms rapidly. Online dating comes in many forms - some more serious than others, but it cannot be denied that it now holds a large place in this generation and has changed both the way people communicate and form meaningful relationships. We wanted to investigate the way it has shaped this current generation and how it will change future generations as technology advances at a frighteninglly fast pace. Technology meets psychology, or maybe in this case does technology <strong>define</strong> psychology?</em></td>
