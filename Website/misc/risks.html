<h1>Technology Risks</h1>
<h3>Why Traditional Security Does Not Work with Cloud Databases</h3>
<p>Security in cloud databases is not the same as on-premises servers. Providers offer multiple versions of cloud databases as a 
	service to businesses. They also provide essential security tools, but this is a starting point rather than an end point. 
	The fact of the matter is that cloud security is a shared responsibility - and this is as true for databases as for the rest of your infrastructure. 
</p>
<h3>1. Unauthorized Resource Usage</h3>
<p>Unused resources also present security risks. They provide an entry point for attackers to breach your system. When a security breach does happen, 
	it’s almost impossible to pinpoint the source of the vulnerability due to the sprawl of unused resources. 
</p>
<h3>2. Data Breaches</h3>
<p>Data breaches come with hefty consequences. One of them is having to pay expensive non-compliance penalties (e.g. GDPR fines). 
	They also break customer trust, leading to even more financial losses from lost business. 
</p>
<h3>3. Misconfigured APIs</h3>
<p>APIs are essential in cloud environments due to the number of tools and providers that enterprises work with. 
	Your organization is likely using services from various cloud-based vendors. The risk is some APIs may not be configured correctly. 
	Misconfigured APIs pose serious threats as they can affect data integrity and cause downtime in worst-case scenarios. A compromised 
	API can potentially impact the entire system; even more so if it’s business-critical. To reduce the risk, protect your API 
	endpoints with essential security measures. This includes implementing rate limits and authentication, and encrypting data transfers. 
</p>
<h3>4. Insider Threats</h3>
<p>Cloud database risks can come from within the organization as well. An employee may gain access to sensitive data and use it 
	for malicious purposes. One common scenario is employees stealing their organization’s financial information to siphon company funds. 
	Insider threats are tough for organizations to manage. First, they are difficult to identify without strong detection tools. 
	Like cloud resources, you won’t notice something is wrong until it’s too late. Also, it’s hard to find out the culprits of an 
	insider attack. There’s also the risk of suspecting the wrong individuals, which can lead to lawsuits and damaged employee morale. 
</p>
<h3>5. Poor Visibility</h3>
<p>Poor visibility also limits how proactive organizations can be when dealing with issues. Often, they respond when the problem has already happened. 
	You can improve your database visibility by using monitoring tools to discover important insights about your security and performance. 
	Regular updates and patches are necessary to combat newly-found vulnerabilities.
</p>
<h3>6. Risk to User</h3>
<p>It is not possible to screen and verify the authenticity of every single person on an online dating platform. This means that a malicious user could 
	talk to and gain the trust of an authentic user of the platform, and use that trust to scam or do even worse to them. Personal information about the authentic user's 
	life which they have exposed to the malicious user while they believe they can trust them can also be used in blackmail and threats. This is a very real problem in
	society, as technology provides a large degree of anonymity to users, which can both be used for good and abused. 
</p>
<h5> - Digital Footprint</h5>
<p>A 'Digital Footprint' is a trail you leave behind as you surf the internet. A record of what you happen to do across the interwebs, including emails, personal information
	you enter on websites, search history, social media posts and even social media interations(like reacting to a facebook post "Wow" and commenting). The Digital Footprint 
	that is relevant to this is the main dangers of using a service such for dating. Since profile sharing is a feature available to any user, bullying and harassment, pictures
	on your dating profile as such can be screenshot, saved with bad intent. Scamming, the more personal side of information that a person shares on the internet, to more accessible
	it is for predators to find and use to try to scam others through identify theft. Damage to reputation, as potential employers or people who have taken an interest you in can search
	your name and access 'private information'. It could possibly put you in a tragic postion and affect your chances of being hired and a halt on connection building.
