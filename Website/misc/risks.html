<h3>Why Traditional Security Does Not Work with Cloud Databases</h3>

<p>Security in cloud databases is not the same as on-premises servers. Providers offer multiple versions of cloud databases as a

  The fact of the matter is that cloud security is a shared responsibility - and this is as true for databases as for the rest of your infrastructure.
