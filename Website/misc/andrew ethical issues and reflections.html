<h3>Andrew's Ethical Issues and Response</h3>
<p>My response, ethically towards 'Online Dating' within our society and with the accompany
    of the technology, database storage, in theory a person with access the mass' private imformation
    have the power to sway the masses, in board daylight terms 'blackmail', in bias terms 'evidential
    persuation'. We have all seen what data leaks have looked like in the past with the 'fappening',
    so far the encryption on these apps and databases have been secure but a loose end will appear. 
    I recommend at best to leave as less of a digital footprint on places like this on the internet.
    Data collection will never stop, but you can minimalise the amount you give out.
