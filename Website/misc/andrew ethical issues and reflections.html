	<h3>Andrew's Ethical Issues and Response</h3>
	<p>
		My response based on the 'Topics of Ethical Analysis', ethically towards 'Online Dating' within our society as a responsibile induvudial, with the research done about
		the technology; database storage. In moral theory a person with access the mass' private imformation
		have the power to sway the masses. In board daylight terms 'blackmail', in bias terms 'evidential
		persuation'. We have all seen what data leaks have looked like in the past with the 'fappening',
		so far the encryption on these apps and databases have been secure but a loose end will appear. In this case a dating profile, 
		it is required that you take it professionally, and use the service for its intended purpose. Ethical issues, the 'Quality of Life' impact 
		on its users, people have their reasons to use service as these, for example, some women I personally know use it for the validation on their appearances,
		with the goal to only receive compliments. Some to boost their egos and/or confident in themselves, with too much attention, leads and creates toxic environments.
		With a 'technological advancement' like this, we now have access to meeting people without even having to move from our homes and have a chance at romance with higher probabilities 
		than past generations where we were limited to only people we encounter.
		'Use of Power', many induvudials on dating apps get 'lead on' as the person who has the power is the person of attraction. On the tech side, the people who hold your infomation, chat logs, etc
		have the 'control' over your profile, whether if you are heavily dependant on it or not.
		'Risks & Reliability', mainly the risk these types of services provide is, can you trust 'said' person they proclaim themself to be, without meeting them? Fake name, fake age, etc,
		incidents of 'Catfishes', and sex traffic have happened in the past however most services now have a profile verifier to seperate verified and unverified which I believe is something 
		that should have been implemented upon launch. On the tech side, database storage systems with weak encryptions or employees with ill-intent, could have private imformation stolen & sold or made public and revealed.  
		'Property Rights', as you are using any service, any sort of information you input on there belongs to the service provided, think of as an exchange you provide person details of yourself 
		for the service you are about to receive.
		'Privacy', dating services allow the users to display the 'area' where they are geographically, there is a population of users who tend to use a different location, such as on Hinge,
		you may live in Northcote, but you select Auckland CBD as your location, which is helpful to find more suitors and widens potential outcomes, greatly increasing in oppotunity and 
		throws any stalkers off. Services like tinder offer a feature to 'Go Global'; living in Chicago, however sets location to Auckland. But again your personal private information, what is 
		input onto your profile gets stored and owned by the service.
		'Access & Equity', in this day and age even 5 year olds have a smart hand held device, access dating services are free, sign up free, service free, however features and 'resources' are limited.
		What I mean by this is resources are what you can use to better your experience while using the service, A Free Account vs. A Premium Account, for a prime example, on Tinder, you are able to 
		have 30 affirmation swipes, on premium that becomes unlimited, you are able to 'boost' your account for more views and more views means more traffic, which leads to more oppotunity, this algorithm 
		shows a little competitivity, "Oh I have been talking to (GUY A).." if it had not been for that 'boost' someone else would've got to her first. And (GUY A)'s experience would cease to have happen.
		Then again, who said 'Love' was free :). On the technological side, if your account has not been flagged for any harmful behaviour, the usage of the service should not be denied and treated normally.
		'Honesty & Deception', this service would end up telling you pretty directly, if you happen to receive no matches then I guess that is just how it is, would ruin the confidence of many. 
		The deception part would most likely be how easy it is to actually find a genuine person, especially over the internet, where people are very different from how they are in person. You
		may have seen posts of internet couples working out but what about the ones that did not? A simple 'block' feature and offline presence. Usually the system's algorithm to see how well 
		a profile is doing is they will prompt 'features and resources' based on your data provided and system collected, that project a weird meaning, for example, your profile is doing well, 
		and a prompt for you to purchase a 'boost' appears, to your thoughts, you do not think you need one as you have many matches and profile traffic not bad, however after a couple hours, 
		you have 'run out of people to swipe' and the following day to have 3-4 to appear on your deck of swipes. That is the system deception of your profile succeeding.

		I recommend at best to leave as less of a digital footprint on places like this on the internet. Maybe mingle less too.
		Data collection will never stop, but you can minimalise the amount you give out.
