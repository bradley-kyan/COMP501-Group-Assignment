<h1>Technology Choices</h1>
<p>Based on IBM: IBM. (n.d.). What is data storage? IBM - United States. https://www.ibm.com/topics/data-storage</p>
<br>

<h2><b>Types of storage devices</b></h2>
<p>Because we are focusing on the data collection that comes with online dating, we decided to conduct research on the wide array of storage mediums that organizations can choose from to store collected 
	data.</p>
<h3>SSD and flash storage</h3>
Flash memory is a solid-state technology that uses a flash memory chip to write and store data. Solid state disk flash drives use flash memory to store data. Compared to HDDs, solid-state systems have no 
moving parts, which results in less latency and requires less SSDs.
<br><br>
<h3>Hybrid storage</h3>
SSDs and flashes offer higher output than HDDs, but all-flash systems can be more expensive. Many companies take a hybrid approach that combines both a flash drive's speed and hard drive storage capacity. 
A hybrid storage configuration enables organizations to accomodate a large array of storage needs. It is also very cost-effective.
<br><br>
<h3>Cloud storage</h3>
Cloud-based storage provides a cost-effective alternative to storing files on a local hard drive. Cloud service providers allow you to store your data and files in an external 
location that you access through the internet or a private network connection. Providers host, protect, manage, and maintain servers so that data is always accessible.
<br><br>
<h3>Hybrid cloud storage</h3>
Hybrid cloud storage uses both private and public cloud elements. Hybrid cloud storage allows organizations to choose which cloud to store their data in. For example, highly regulated data 
subject to strict requirements would be suitable for a private cloud storage medium. However, less sensitive data can be stored in the public cloud. 
Some organizations use hybrid clouds to combine their internal storage networks with public cloud storage.
<br><br>
<h3>Backup software and appliances</h3>
Backup storage and appliances protect data loss from disaster, failure or fraud. They make periodic data and application copies to a separate, secondary device and then use those copies for disaster recovery. 
Backup appliances range from HDDs and SSDs to tape drives to servers, but backup storage can also be offered as a service, also known as backup-as-a-service (BaaS). Like most as-a-service solutions, 
BaaS provides a low-cost option to protect data, saving it in a remote location with scalability.
<br><br>
<h2><b>Data collection options</b></h2>
<p>Most online services that collect data (not only online dating services) for targeted ads allow the user to opt out of the collection of this data. Online dating services are no different, and give all 
	users the option to opt out of targeted ads. As well as this, online dating services allow the user to have the option of opting out of certian profile elements being collected (in the form of the user
	not applying a bio or interests) and precise geolocation data. These services would enhacnce the user experience, but would allow the organization that runs the online dating service to collect more 
	(and possibly sensitive) data about the user. </p>
<br><br>	
<h2><b>Data storage devices</b></h2>
<p>To store data, regardless of form, users need storage devices. Data storage devices come in two main categories: direct area storage and network-based storage. 

	Direct area storage, also known as direct-attached storage (DAS), is as the name implies. This storage is often in the immediate area and directly connected to the computing machine accessing it. 
	Often, it's the only machine connected to it. DAS can provide decent local backup services, too, but sharing is limited. DAS devices include floppy disks, optical discs—compact discs (CDs) and 
	digital video discs (DVDs)—hard disk drives (HDD), flash drives and solid-state drives (SSD). 
	Network-based storage allows more than one computer to access it through a network, making it better for data sharing and collaboration. Its off-site storage capability also makes it better 
	suited for backups and data protection. Two common network-based storage setups are network-attached storage (NAS) and storage area network (SAN). 
	NAS is often a single device made up of redundant storage containers or a redundant array of independent disks (RAID). SAN storage can be a network of multiple devices of various types, 
	including SSD and flash storage, hybrid storage, hybrid cloud storage, backup software and appliances, and cloud storage. Here are how NAS and SAN differ:</p>
	
	<h3>NAS</h3>
	<p>Single storage device or RAI</p>
	<p>File storage system</p>
	<p>TCP/IP Ethernet network</p>
	<p>Limited users</p>
	<p>Limited speed</p>
	<p>Limited expansion options</p>
	<p>Lower cost and easy setup</p>	
	
	<h3>SAN</h3>
	<p>Network of multiple devices</p>
	<p>Block storage system</p>
	<p>Fibre Channel network</p>
	<p>Optimized for multiple users</p>
	<p>Faster performance</p>
	<p>Highly expandable</p>
<br><br>
<h2><b>Forms of data storage </b></h2>
<p>Data can be recorded and stored in three main forms: file storage, block storage and object storage.</p>
<h3>File Storage</h3>
<p>File storage, also called file-level or file-based storage, is a hierarchical storage methodology used to organize and store data. In other words, data is stored in files, the files are 
	organized in folders and the folders are organized under a hierarchy of directories and subdirectories.
</p>
<h3>Block storage</h3>
<p>Block storage, sometimes referred to as block-level storage, is a technology used to store data into blocks. The blocks are then stored as separate pieces, each with a unique identifier.
	Developers favor block storage for computing situations that require fast, efficient and reliable data transfer.
</p>
<h3>Object storage</h3>
<p>Object storage, often referred to as object-based storage, is a data storage architecture for handling large amounts of unstructured data. This data doesn't conform to, or can't be 
	organized easily into, a traditional relational database with rows and columns. Examples include email, videos, photos, web pages, audio files, sensor data, and other types of media 
	and web content (textual or non-textual).
