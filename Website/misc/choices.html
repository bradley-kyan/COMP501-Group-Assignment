<h2><b>Types of storage devices</b></h2>
<p>Because we are focusing on the data collection that comes with online dating, we decided to conduct research on the wide array of storage mediums that organizations can choose from to store collected 
	data.</p>
<h3>SSD and flash storage</h3>
Flash memory is a solid-state technology that uses a flash memory chip to write and store data. Solid state disk flash drives use flash memory to store data. Compared to HDDs, solid-state systems have no 
moving parts, which results in less latency and requires less SSDs.
<br><br>
<h3>Hybrid storage</h3>
SSDs and flashes offer higher output than HDDs, but all-flash systems can be more expensive. Many companies take a hybrid approach that combines both a flash drive's speed and hard drive storage capacity. 
A hybrid storage configuration enables organizations to accomodate a large array of storage needs. It is also very cost-effective.
<br><br>
<h3>Cloud storage</h3>
Cloud-based storage provides a cost-effective alternative to storing files on a local hard drive. Cloud service providers allow you to store your data and files in an external 
location that you access through the internet or a private network connection. Providers host, protect, manage, and maintain servers so that data is always accessible.
<br><br>
<h3>Hybrid cloud storage</h3>
Hybrid cloud storage uses both private and public cloud elements. Hybrid cloud storage allows organizations to choose which cloud to store their data in. For example, highly regulated data 
subject to strict requirements would be suitable for a private cloud storage medium. However, less sensitive data can be stored in the public cloud. 
Some organizations use hybrid clouds to combine their internal storage networks with public cloud storage.
