<p>1</p>
<p>Talk about the security and privacy. As technology has advanced and everything is becoming cloud based. The company that holds the most data out of the rest eventually 
	holds the most power and things that have pushed the progression quicker is received covid. An example was the mass jumped on the covid scanner. It's bad, but like if 
	something like this were to happen because of ill intent. It just shows how easy it is to get the population to just feel like “oh yeah, this app tracks you” and the 
	question of privacy and security in the future technology advances so will undetectable tracking. Current website policies have changed now they have to announce that 
	they're going to take data from you, for example in order to if you want to continue scrolling down this website. You’ll have to accept all cookies and information 
	about me you know me about with that whole thing is that you know them asking for cookies, that was in the basic the reason why they said that they were doing that 
	was also illegal according to like the lord, but they just did it wrong, but I think too with the with the whole thing, it's you know everyone. It's the whole hype 
	around people and educators like around getting rich quick off buying something that blindside people from the actual risks behind it to later. Don't understand how 
	the technology works, and he just one person become rich, and then I think yeah, I'm going to put all my money into this if we talked about in crypto. </p>
<p>00:00 - 01:56</p>
<p>2</p>
<p>So, with the advancement of Technology increasing every year will the restriction of freedom, especially when it comes to the security, security in games now 
	don’t just IP ban you because a VPN can get over that. They now hardware ID ban you. Take “Valorant” ban system for example. </p>
<p>01:59 - 02:58</p>
<p>3</p>
<p>With security things you might as well get let the majority of people have it. Aiming for user adoption. Making a security software where only a limited portion 
	of devices are able to adopt it defeats the purpose and promotes counter productivity, make it available for everyone know we have like a brief idea. Ideas 
	are what we need in order to be shaped into something that we could use later in our proposal so to say according to this presentation. </p>
<p>02:59 - 03:56</p>
<p>4</p>
<p>So, this is the first stage of our team project. We propose the chosen topic is online dating and to investigate that. This will be approved or reviewed. 
	So, when the first step we need to find something that we and will comfortable like researching useful information from reliable source. Sources from 
	Western media credibility has somewhat lost and plummeted, so avoid dodgy ones. I hope we're able to find something in our course related resources 
	or from AUT library. </p>
<p>03:59 - 04:58</p>
<p>5</p>
<p>I read about online dating within that book Tony mentioned, it made me interested. I'm looking into online dating and finding supporting evidence. 
	You know long-distance relationship (LDR) nowadays are the norms. You know if you're playing Valorant, from New Zealand and your girlfriend plays your 
	pockets Sage from Sydney, a plane ticket to a plane ticket to Sydney is just an expensive bus ticket, copium. All this matching e-couple names; his and 
	hers or mommy and mommys baby. </p>
<p>4:59 - 05:59</p>
<p>6</p>
<p>Typical “e-girl” encounters, they’re all the same, you will be matched into teams with them when you play and climb the ranks. You fall into a 
	trap if you boost them because at some point they’ll be like, “I don't want to play with you anymore”, scene where Andy dropped Woody away for Buzz. </p>
<p>10:59 - 11:59</p>
<p>7</p>
<p>Yeah so, briefly describe your topic instead of having intimacy person-to-person. You are now dating online connecting with them via the internet 
	you have emotional availability for someone who's like 1000 miles away building a connection mostly consisting of a game, hobbies and investing 
	time to building that relationship having never met a person in real life that's already at the brief description of our topic online dating. 
	Then we outline your team members roles and responsibilities. Maybe as a team name we call ourselves the catfishes. </p>
<p>13:00 - 13:52</p>
<p>8</p>
<p>Yeah, we should join online discord dating servers as a girl as 3, till I we can prove how much of a joke it is, imagine falling in love with just the voice. </p>
<p>14:04 - 15:15</p>
<p>9</p>
<p>The illusion of being together, two people grow closer by playing a game together online, and you're like 10000 mi apart. It's kind of a sad reality 
	because you'll never get to see each other unless you finished your studies, have some money saved up, buy a plane ticket go there and visit. You know 
	then there is family approval.  While this LDR is happening, one party member could be finding attachment locally simultaneously. The trust is not 
	the same as it is in person to person, we can actually see body language. </p>
<p>15:40 - 17:04</p>
<p>10</p>
<p>With online dating so efficient to slide into dms(direct message) and with nowadays making the first move seen with double standards, 
	if a guy asks for your number, you say you get away pervert, however it was flipped. “Girl empowerment movement” 
	#normalisegirlsmakingthefirstmove, you know. We can add that in our minutes as well, it’s so different not approaching people 
	where it’s very easy and very different from how you approach them in real life the in real life frame when you approach someone body language. </p>
<p>17:10 - 19:31</p>
<p>11</p>
<p>Asking in person, your posture, your attractiveness on your face, your hair, how smoothly you execute your delivery, exactly everything, 
	you are graded on and then they give an answer. Yes or no. Asking online is just via voice your, you could be in your underwear but 
	that isn’t a problem because they’re engaged with your voice. If one online person says no, just go next. Got nothing to lose, 
	it happens so frequently and regarded as online speed dating. </p>
<p>19:40 - 22:12</p>
<p>12</p>
<p>I suggest that we briefly describe our topic and its relevance towards society nowadays, with the inclusion of internet 
	safety and awareness towards the more introverted audience, because introverts especially, really like using online things 
	which doesn't really require in person kind of touch, to then have online presence as a way of expressing anonymously 
	and/or openly. </p>
<p>22:40 - 24:11</p>
<p>13</p>
<p>Online dating is like “oh yeah talking with you is just fine”, you are content temporarily then that feeling 
	goes away and turns into “I wish you were with me, cuddling. I want to hold you tightly within my arms”, 
	so I'm going to come to your house in Atlanta during my semester break, purchase a plane ticket then 
	you tunnel vision and focus on making money. Disregarding other important things in life and the people 
	around you, and you know like that’s a priority check right there. </p>
<p>24:56 - 26:13</p>
<p>14</p>
<p>I kind of have a lot of prior background knowledge of this is because of personal matters, have used Discord, Hinge, 
	Bumble, and Tinder. I was down bad astronomically. </p>
<p>26:16 - 27:20</p>
